 

Build an interactive user directory

Create an interface that allows a user to view user data (sample data is attached). 
The interface should allow a visitor to browse a list of names and then select an item to view more 
information.

  Goal

o To determine your development proficiency and creativity when creating a solution to a 
problem from the ground up.

  Output Requirements

o A single, HTML page with no server side logic (all state must be managed by JS)

o The sample data must be fetched using Javascript (i.e. to simulate an API)

o The page must be styled beyond what is provided by simply a CSS framework (if you are using one).
 Eg. If you are using Bootstrap, we shouldnt be able to tell visually that it is Bootstrap.

o Use package managers for any front end dependencies you may need

o The page must employ URI routing to allow deep linking to users and provide resiliency to page 
refreshes

o A Readme file should be included with instructions on how to install and view the project.

o Browser requirements:

 Chrome latest

 IE9

 iOS 8 / iPhone 6S

 Android 5 / Galaxy s6

  Additional features you may consider:

o Search

o Google map to show address location

o View state transition/animation

  Notes

o Prioritise clarity over cleverness

o Ensure your JS and CSS is organised and clear

o You can use any frameworks of your choosing, however, ensure you can justify your decisions

  Delivery

o Your code should be delivered as a zip file via email

o Your zip package should contain all code, assets and installation instructions (if needed) 
in order to download packages.
